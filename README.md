# ProjectCrudFullStack

This system was created to register the level and date of a team developer. It is a fullstack system and I used JS language in the frontend and backend.

In this project, I do use the tools GitHub to apply good practice for the creation of development. The rules were:

- TO DO: All of the things that needed to be built;
- Doing: those that  was been done
- Finish: All that was ready to use.
